CycloneDX Maven Plugin
=========

The CycloneDX Maven plugin creates an aggregate of all direct and transitive dependencies of a project 
and creates a valid CycloneDX SBOM. CycloneDX is a lightweight software bill of materials 
(SBOM) specification designed for use in application security contexts and supply chain component analysis.

Maven Usage
-------------------

```xml
<!-- uses default configuration -->
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.cyclonedx</groupId>
        <artifactId>cyclonedx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.5.3</version>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```


Default Values
-------------------
```xml
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.cyclonedx</groupId>
        <artifactId>cyclonedx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.5.3</version>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <phase>package</phase>
                <goals>
                    <goal>makeAggregateBom</goal>
                </goals>
            </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
            <projectType>library</projectType>
            <schemaVersion>1.3</schemaVersion>
            <includeBomSerialNumber>true</includeBomSerialNumber>
            <includeCompileScope>true</includeCompileScope>
            <includeProvidedScope>true</includeProvidedScope>
            <includeRuntimeScope>true</includeRuntimeScope>
            <includeSystemScope>true</includeSystemScope>
            <includeTestScope>false</includeTestScope>
            <includeLicenseText>false</includeLicenseText>
            <outputFormat>all</outputFormat>
            <outputDirectory>target</outputDirectory>
            <outputName>bom</outputName>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```

Excluding Projects
-------------------
With `makeAggregateBom` goal it is possible to exclude certain Maven Projects (artifactId) from getting included in bom.

* Pass `-DexcludeTestProject=true` to skip any maven project artifactId containing the word "test"
* Pass `-DexcludeArtifactId=comma separated id` to skip based on artifactId

Notes
-------------------
As of v2.5.0, the default CycloneDX BOM format is v1.3 and will produce both XML and JSON.

Goals
-------------------
The CycloneDX Maven plugin contains the following three goals:
* makeBom
* makeAggregateBom
* makePackageBom

By default, the BOM(s) will be attached as an additional artifacts during a Maven install or deploy.

* `${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-cyclonedx.xml`
* `${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-cyclonedx.json`

This may be switched off by setting `cyclonedx.skipAttach` to true.

makeBom and makeAggregateBom can optionally be skipped completely by setting `cyclonedx.skip` to true.

Examples
-------------------
`> mvn clean compile cyclonedx:makeBom`

## CycloneDX Schema Support

The following table provides information on the version of this node module, the CycloneDX schema version supported, 
as well as the output format options. Use the latest possible version of this node module that is the compatible with 
the CycloneDX version supported by the target system.

| Version | Schema Version | Format(s) |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| 2.5.x | CycloneDX v1.3 | XML/JSON |
| 2.0.x | CycloneDX v1.2 | XML/JSON |
| 1.4.x | CycloneDX v1.1 | XML |
| 1.0x | CycloneDX v1.0 | XML |

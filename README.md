CycloneDX Maven Plugin
=========

The CycloneDX Maven plugin creates an aggregate of all dependencies and transitive dependencies of a project 
and creates a valid CycloneDX bill-of-material document from the results. CycloneDX is a lightweight BOM 
specification that is easily created, human readable, and simple to parse. 

Maven Usage
-------------------

```xml
<!-- uses default configuration -->
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.cyclonedx</groupId>
        <artifactId>cyclonedx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.6.3</version>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```


Default Values
-------------------
```xml
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.cyclonedx</groupId>
        <artifactId>cyclonedx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.6.3</version>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <phase>verify</phase>
                <goals>
                    <goal>makeAggregateBom</goal>
                </goals>
            </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
            <schemaVersion>1.1</schemaVersion>
            <includeBomSerialNumber>true</includeBomSerialNumber>
            <includeCompileScope>true</includeCompileScope>
            <includeProvidedScope>true</includeProvidedScope>
            <includeRuntimeScope>true</includeRuntimeScope>
            <includeSystemScope>true</includeSystemScope>
            <includeTestScope>false</includeTestScope>
            <includeDependencyGraph>true</includeDependencyGraph>
            <includeLicenses>true</includeLicenses>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```

Notes
-------------------
As of v1.4.0, the default CycloneDX BOM format is v1.1 with included serial number. 

Goals
-------------------
The CycloneDX Maven plugin contains the following two goals:
* makeBom
* makeAggregateBom

By default (as of v1.6.0) the BOM will be attached as an additional artifact and thereby 
installed, uploaded, or deployed as `${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-cyclonedx.xml`. 
This may be switched off by setting `cyclonedx.skipAttach` to true.

makeBom and makeAggregateBom can optionally be skipped completely by setting `cyclonedx.skip` to true.
